## [Install Docker on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCSMDtHPBso)

##### Update your system's package index and ensure that all packages installed on your system are up-to-date:

Check current system time
```sh
date
```

Modify system time
```sh
dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

```sh
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

##### Install the dependencies necessary to add Docker’s package repository:
```sh
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
```

##### Add Docker’s official GPG key:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

##### Add the Docker repository to the system:
```sh
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

##### Update the package index again to include the new Docker repository:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

##### Install Docker Community Edition using the following command:
```sh
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

##### Verify that Docker is installed correctly by running the hello-world image:
```sh
sudo docker run hello-world
```

##### That’s it! You now have Docker installed on your Ubuntu 22.04 system.

## You can also install `Docker` and `Docker-Compose` following the steps below
##### Pull down the installtion script to your local machine, this will download a script called "install_docker_nproxyman.sh" to your current directory.
```sh
wget https://gitlab.com/bmcgonag/docker_installs/-/raw/main/install_docker_nproxyman.sh
```

##### Change the permissions on the file to allow it to run with:
```sh
chmod +x install_docker_nproxyman.sh
```

##### Run the installation script
```sh
./install_docker_nproxyman.sh
````
You'll be prompted to identify your OS/Distro.  If you run an OS based on one of the options, simply select that option.

Next, you'll be asked if you want to install Docker, Docker-CE, NGinX Proxy Manager, and / or Portainer-CE.

Feel free to install them all, or just Docker and Docker-Compose.

##### That’s it! You now have Docker installed on your Ubuntu 22.04 system.

### 2. [Install `Nginx Proxy Manager`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2zl2TlDzd8)

If you have installed `Nginx Proxy Manager`, the yml file of it may be like this
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '81:81'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

Navigate to `<IP of the host>:81` in the browser, you will see the login page below

When the Nginx Proxy Manager first starts, log in with the following username and password:

Default Proxy Manager username: 
```
admin@example.com
```

Default Proxy Manager password: 
```
changeme
```

Once sign in, you can modify the username and password here

### 3. [Useful components on docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBwIm6m6x7M)
#### 1. [Heimdall - an amazingly clean, user-friendly Shortcut and Informational Dashboard!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFqUXN0jxMQ)
* [Heimdall official github](https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall)
* [Heimdall site](https://heimdall.site/)
* [Heimdall dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall)
* [Install Heimdall step by step guidance](https://wiki.opensourceisawesome.com/books/self-hosted-dashboards/page/install-heimdall-a-beaiful-shortcut-and-informational-dashboard)

Create a directory for Heimdall
```sh
sudo su root
```

```sh
cd ~
```

```sh
cd docker
```

```sh
mkdir heimdall
```

Then navigate to the new directory
```sh
cd heimdall
```

Then we need to create a file called "docker-compose.yml"
```sh
nano docker-compose.yml
```

We need to paste the following into the file we've just opened
```yml
version: "2.1"
services:
  heimdall:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall
    container_name: heimdall
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Chicago
    volumes:
      - /home/<your-user>/heimdall/config:/config
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    restart: unless-stopped
```

We may need to change a couple of things in the file you just pasted.

###### Change the TZ (timezone) if needed, to be the correct timezone for your location.
###### Change the PUID and PGID to be your user's group and user IDs. You can find them in the terminal by typing the command `id`

###### In my lab
```sh
id
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96930989/227763983-6e2fdabc-f243-447d-860e-a166e5c3ba30.png)

###### On the left side of the colon ":" in the volume section, make sure to set the path to where you have created the "heimdall" folder above.

###### On the left side of the colon ":" in the ports section, make sure to set a port that is not in use on your host.  If 8080 is free, then just use it.

###### So in my lab, the yml file would be
```yml
version: "2.1"
services:
  heimdall:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall
    container_name: heimdall
    environment:
      - PUID=0
      - PGID=0
      - TZ=China/Shanghai
    volumes:
      - /gjsheimdall/config:/config
    ports:
      - 8280:80
    restart: unless-stopped
    
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96930989/227771048-6e7f109e-4354-4250-bacb-6fca7b03f957.png)

Once these steps are done, save the file with `CTRL + O`, then Enter to confirm, and exit the nano editor with `CTRL + X`
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Give it time to download the image, and start the container. Remember to add inbound rule for the port in defined in the yml file

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96930989/227764638-202e5941-738d-454b-968c-882b734756e5.png)

When you see "done" in the terminal, the hemdall is started.
