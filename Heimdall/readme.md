* [Heimdall official github](https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall)
* [Heimdall site](https://heimdall.site/)
* [Heimdall dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall)
* [Install Heimdall step by step guidance](https://wiki.opensourceisawesome.com/books/self-hosted-dashboards/page/install-heimdall-a-beaiful-shortcut-and-informational-dashboard)

Create a directory for Heimdall
```sh
sudo su root
```

```sh
cd ~
```

```sh
cd docker
```

```sh
mkdir heimdall
```

Then navigate to the new directory
```sh
cd heimdall
```

Then we need to create a file called "docker-compose.yml"
```sh
nano docker-compose.yml
```

We need to paste the following into the file we've just opened
```yml
version: "2.1"
services:
  heimdall:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall
    container_name: heimdall
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Chicago
    volumes:
      - /home/<your-user>/heimdall/config:/config
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    restart: unless-stopped
```

We may need to change a couple of things in the file you just pasted.

###### Change the TZ (timezone) if needed, to be the correct timezone for your location.
###### Change the PUID and PGID to be your user's group and user IDs. You can find them in the terminal by typing the command `id`

###### In my lab
```sh
id
```

###### On the left side of the colon ":" in the volume section, make sure to set the path to where you have created the "heimdall" folder above.

###### On the left side of the colon ":" in the ports section, make sure to set a port that is not in use on your host.  If 8080 is free, then just use it.

###### So in my lab, the yml file would be
```yml
version: "2.1"
services:
  heimdall:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall
    container_name: heimdall
    environment:
      - PUID=0
      - PGID=0
      - TZ=China/Shanghai
    volumes:
      - /gjsheimdall/config:/config
    ports:
      - 8280:80
    restart: unless-stopped
    
```

Once these steps are done, save the file with `CTRL + O`, then Enter to confirm, and exit the nano editor with `CTRL + X`
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

It takes some time to download the image, and start the container. Remember to add inbound rule for the port in defined in the yml file

When you see "done" in the terminal, the hemdall is started.
